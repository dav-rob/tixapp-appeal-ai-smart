# Introduction
The Docutain SDK for Capacitor brings high quality document scanning, data extraction, text recognition and PDF creation features to your mobile apps, known from the world famous Docutain document management app used by millions of users around the world.
Benefit from a super fast and easy integration by using our Ready-To-Use UI Components.
## Requirements[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")
### Operating System[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#operating-system "Direct link to Operating System")
  * Android 5.0 (Api Level 21) and higher
  * iOS 11 and higher

### Environment Setup[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#environment-setup "Direct link to Environment Setup")
  * NodeJS 16 and higher 
  * Xcode 14.1 and higher
  * Android Studio 2022.2.1 and higher

### Hardware[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#hardware "Direct link to Hardware")
  * rear-facing camera if you want to use the document scanning functionality
  * supported ABIs: `armeabi-v7` `arm64-v8a` `arm64`

### Emulator[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#emulator "Direct link to Emulator")
Full emulator support is currently supported for Android only. On iOS the app also builds and runs, but the SDK does not provide any actual functionality.
Although you can run the SDK on an emulator, we strongly recommend using real devices.
Depending on the emulated camera, you may not be able to test/evaluate the full functionality of the Docutain SDK.
## Data protection[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#data-protection "Direct link to Data protection")
The Docutain SDK works completely offline. All data generated by the Docutain SDK is only stored on the end user's device and never transferred to an external server / cloud service. 
This eliminates any data protection risk and makes the Docutain SDK the first choice even for high-security sectors, e.g. banking and insurance.
If you whish to upload any data to any server, you need to handle this yourself.
## Reliability[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/intro#reliability "Direct link to Reliability")
Since the Docutain SDK runs offline on the respective device, without any server connection, reliability is guaranteed.

## License Key[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#license-key "Direct link to License Key")
The Docutain SDK is a commercial product and requires a paid license for production use.
It needs a valid, non-expired license key in order to work. On Android the license key is bound to the `applicationId` in your build.gradle and on iOS to the `CFBundleIdentifier` in your info.plist. Any attempt to use a license key in an app with a different `applicationId` or `CFBundleIdentifier` will fail.
### Trial license[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#trial-license "Direct link to Trial license")
Without a license key, you can test the Docutain SDK for 60 seconds.
In order to get a trial license, please visit our website via [https://sdk.docutain.com/TrialLicense](https://sdk.docutain.com/TrialLicense?Source=9) to generate a trial license key.
### Production license[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#production-license "Direct link to Production license")
To get information about the SDK's functionality and pricing and to purchase a production license, please **contact us**.
## Initialize the SDK[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#initialize-the-sdk "Direct link to Initialize the SDK")
Make sure you have followed the [**Getting started**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/getStarted) guide.
In order to use any functionality of the SDK, you must initialize it first.
```
import{DocutainSDK}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk';exportclassHomePage{constructor(){this.initDocutainSDK();}asyncinitDocutainSDK(){try{awaitDocutainSDK.initSDK({licenseKey:"<YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>"})}catch(error){//init of Docutain SDK failed, get the last error messageconsole.error(error);//your logic to deactivate access to SDK functionality}}}
```

caution
If the initialization fails, you are responsible to deactivate access to SDK functionality.
## Logging[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#logging "Direct link to Logging")
The SDK writes certain information into a log file. You can get the log file by calling `DocutainSDK.getTraceFile()`. You can send this log file to us if you have any issues/bugs with the SDK. The Logger has certain levels that you can set depending on your needs. However, we suggest to leave the level to it's default value which ensures that in case of any issues/bugs we can get all the information we need from you.
```
//get the log fileconst traceFile =(awaitDocutainSDK.getTraceFile()).fileUri;//set the log levelawaitDocutainSDK.setLogLevel({logLevel:LogLevel.Error});
```

Depending on the log level, some temporary files get written. These files, if any, will be deleted everytime the SDK starts, so you don't need to worry about spamming the files dir.
If you like, you can delete these files manually by using `await DocutainSDK.deleteTempFiles({deleteTraceFileContent: false})`.

    * [Trial license](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#trial-license)
    * [Production license](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit#production-license)  * [About](https://sdk.Docutain.com)

  * Document Scan

# Document Scan
With Docutain's Document Scanner SDK for capacitor, you can integrate document scanning into your app within minutes. It includes ready-to-use UI components that can be altered to your needs and coprorate design.
It is also possible to use the Document Scanner on imported images.
![ScanEditPreview](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/ScanEditUI-b57833e318cfd8f246317a5d693e6a22.png)
## Scan with Camera[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#scan-with-camera "Direct link to Scan with Camera")
### Camera Permission[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#camera-permission "Direct link to Camera Permission")
#### Android[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#android "Direct link to Android")
Declare the following permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
```
<uses-permissionandroid:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/><uses-featureandroid:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
```

info
Runtime permission for camera is handled automatically by the Docutain SDK.
#### iOS[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#ios "Direct link to iOS")
You need to specify the reason for requesting access to the camera as part of the `NSCameraUsageDescription` in the `Info.plist`. If you don't the app will crash.
![NSCameraUsageDescription](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/NSCameraUsageDescription-2e43ad7b2b43a107283452dce1a04cec.png)
### Start Camera Scan[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#start-camera-scan "Direct link to Start Camera Scan")
To start the scan process you only have to call `DocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner` and wait for it to return.
You can pass options to change some behaviours and theming to adopt it to your needs. See **[Change default scan behaviour](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#change-default-scan-behaviour)** for possible custom settings.
```
import{DocutainSDK,PDFPageFormat}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'asyncscanDocument(){try{awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({//customize the scanner config according to your needs});//user finished scan process, continue with your workflow//generate PDFvar destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:"sample.pdf",directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,overWrite:true,pageFormat:PDFPageFormat.A4})).fileUri//get detected Textconst text =(awaitDocutainSDK.getText()).text//get extracted data const analyzeData =(awaitDocutainSDK.analyze()).data;}catch(error){if((error as{ code?: string })?.code ==='CANCELED'){//user canceled scan processconsole.log(`user canceled`);}else{console.error(error);}}}
```

## Scan from imported images[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan#scan-from-imported-images "Direct link to Scan from imported images")
It is also possible to use the Document Scanner on already taken images, for example images selected from the users photo gallery. The process of starting the scanner on imported images is the same as when scanning with the camera. The only difference is defining a different `Source` in the `DocumentScannerConfiguration`. Possible values are:
  * `Camera` : This is the default value. Starts the Document Scanner using the devices camera.
  * `Image` : Starts the Document Scanner on images provided by you via code. Pass `sourceImages` to the `DocumentScannerConfiguration` containing the paths to the images to be scanned.
  * `Gallery` : Opens the user's photo gallery in single select mode. The Document Scanner is run on the selected image.
  * `GalleryMultiple` : Opens the user's photo gallery in multi select mode. The Document Scanner is run on the selected images.
  * `CameraImport` : Same as `Camera` but shows an additional import button which the user can use to import files as well. 

The following sample shows how to open the photo gallery in multi select mode and run the Document Scanner on the selected images:
```
import{DocutainSDK,Source,PDFPageFormat}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'asyncscanDocument(){try{awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({source:Source.GalleryMultiple});//user finished scan process, continue with your workflow//generate PDFvar destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:"sample.pdf",directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,overWrite:true,pageFormat:PDFPageFormat.A4})).fileUri//get detected Textconst text =(awaitDocutainSDK.getText()).text//get extracted data const analyzeData =(awaitDocutainSDK.analyze()).data;}catch(error){if((error as{ code?: string })?.code ==='CANCELED'){//user canceled scan processconsole.log(`user canceled`);}else{console.error(error);}}}
```

  * Photo Payment

# Photo Payment
With Docutain's Photo Payment SDK you can integrate photo payment into your app within minutes. It includes ready-to-use UI components that can be altered to your needs and coprorate design.
![photoPayment](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/photoPayment-a27975b8f46493bb620ca995fd2ef08c.png)
## Data Protection[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#data-protection "Direct link to Data Protection")
Invoices contain lots of private information that need to be protected. By using the Docutain Photo Payment SDK, you have chosen the only available solution that provides 100% data protection.
This is because all functionality, especially analyzing the document content to find the relevant payment information happens on device, 100% offline. Meaning, no data at all is transfered to any external server or cloud service. 
This eliminates any data protection risk and makes the Docutain SDK the first choice.
## Photo Payment[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#photo-payment-1 "Direct link to Photo Payment")
### Initialization[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#initialization "Direct link to Initialization")
  * Follow the [**Getting started**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/getStarted) guide
  * Initialize the Docutain SDK as described [**here**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit)

### Start Photo Payment[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#start-photo-payment "Direct link to Start Photo Payment")
To start the photo payment process you only have to call `DocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment` and wait for it to return.
You can pass options to change some behaviours and theming to adopt it to your needs. See **[Change default scan behaviour](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#change-default-scan-behaviour)** for possible custom settings.
```
import{DocutainSDK}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'asyncstartPhotoPayment(){try{const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({//customize the photo payment process according to your needs});if(result.data!==""){//payment information has been extracted//result.data is a JSON string containing the information//extract the fields you need and pass it on to your payment sheet}else{//no data was extracted at all//Note: this case is only reachable, if you disabled the Empty Result Screen}}catch(error){if((error as{ code?: string })?.code ==='CANCELED'){//user canceled scan processconsole.log(`user canceled`);}else{console.error(error);}}}
```

### Extract Payment Data[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#extract-payment-data "Direct link to Extract Payment Data")
The payment data will be returned as `JSON` string. By default, it will have the following structure:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"DB Fernverkehr AG","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"60643","City":"Frankfurt am Main","Street":"BahnCard-Service","Phone":"0302970","CustomerId":"","Bank":[{"BIC":"PBNKDEFFXXX","IBAN":"DE02100100100152517108"}]},"Date":"2024-10-14","Amount":"244.00","InvoiceId":"2023174086","Reference":"RNr:2023174086 vom 14.10.2024","SEPACreditor":"DB Vertrieb GmbH"}
```

If you don't need it, you can disable reading the `BIC`:
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({analyzeConfig:{readBIC:false}});
```

Instead of a `Bank` element, the data will then only have an `IBAN` element:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"DB Fernverkehr AG","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"60643","City":"Frankfurt am Main","Street":"BahnCard-Service","Phone":"0302970","CustomerId":"","IBAN":["DE76570928000208303503","DE41510500150710030316"]},"Date":"2024-10-14","Amount":"244.00","InvoiceId":"2023174086","Reference":"RNr:2023174086 vom 14.10.2024","SEPACreditor":"DB Vertrieb GmbH"}
```

Optionally, you can enable reading the payment state, telling you whether the invoice has already been marked as paid.
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({analyzeConfig:{readPaymentState:true}});
```

The payment data will then have an additional value `PaymentState` which contains either `Paid` or `ToBePaid`:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"DB Fernverkehr AG","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"60643","City":"Frankfurt am Main","Street":"BahnCard-Service","Phone":"0302970","CustomerId":"","Bank":[{"BIC":"PBNKDEFFXXX","IBAN":"DE02100100100152517108"}]},"Date":"2024-10-14","Amount":"244.00","InvoiceId":"2023174086","Reference":"RNr:2023174086 vom 14.10.2024","PaymentState":"ToBePaid","SEPACreditor":"DB Vertrieb GmbH"}
```

## Onboarding[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#onboarding "Direct link to Onboarding")
The SDK provides 2 optional onboarding possibilities that will be shown to the user on first start with some default content. You can customize it according to your needs or disable it completely.
See [**Onboarding**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding) for details.
![onboardingDataProtection](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingDataProtection-4499ace510a03b6378b8230f869a6a71.jpg) ![onboardingLightingConditions](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingLightingConditions-9b8e598d77be388c84fb27045c90f490.jpg)
## Scan Tips[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#scan-tips "Direct link to Scan Tips")
The SDK provides an optional toolbar item within the scanning screen, that when clicked, will open some tips on how to get the best scan result. By default it is activated and shows some default items. You can customize it according to your needs or disable it completely.
See [**Scan Tips**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/scantips) for details.
![scanTips](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/scanTips-27c79e7f9542aaa23a07dfc51de1b1a5.jpg)
## Empty Result Screen[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#empty-result-screen "Direct link to Empty Result Screen")
By default, when no payment data could be extracted (meaning, no IBAN, no SEPACreditor, no Amount), the SDK provides a screen with some tips and an option to cancel or to retry the scan. You can customize it according to your needs or disable it completely.
![emptyResultScreen](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/emptyResultScreen-721269664f9d03ee2bc8ade1f2dca5f5.jpg)
### Disable[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#disable "Direct link to Disable")
To disable the empty result screen, set the `emptyResultScreen` option to null:
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({emptyResultScreen:null});
```

### Customize[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/photoPayment#customize "Direct link to Customize")
Button colors are configured by the global **[color configuration](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/colorConfig)**.
If you want to provide your own items instead of the default items, you can do that by providing your own list of `DocutainListItem`. Each item consists of an `image`, a `title` and a `message`.
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({emptyResultScreen:{items:[{image:"my_icon",title:"my item 1",message:"message my emptyResultScreen item 1\nline 2"},{image:"photopayment_doc_detection_hint",title:"my item 2",message:"message my emptyResultScreen item 2\nline 2"},]}});
```

The following provides an overview of the currently available options to alter the `emptyResultScreen`:
Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`items`| `DocutainListItem[]`| The items you want to show as scan tips. If you don't provide any items, some default items will be displayed.  
`title`| `string`| The title to be displayed in the top toolbar.  
`repeatButton`| `DocutainButton`| The button that restarts the scan process.  
info
You can get the default items used by the SDK to use them for your own list.
```
const emptyResultScreenDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.emptyResultScreenDefaultItems()).items;
```

The following sample alters the `repeatButton`:
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({emptyResultScreen:{repeatButton:{title:"my repeat button"}}});
```

## PDF Creation

> Source: https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation

  * PDF Creation

# PDF Creation
The Docutain SDK for Capacitor comes with the ability to create searchable PDF documents either from a **[scanned document](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan)** with Docutain's Scanner SDK or **[imported file](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/fileImport)**. 
## Create a PDF[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation#create-a-pdf "Direct link to Create a PDF")
```
import{DocutainSDK,PDFPageFormat}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'//...//scan or import file//...try{var destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:"sample.pdf",directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,overWrite:true,})).fileUri}catch(error){console.error(error);}
```

tip
You can specify to overwrite an existing file and the PDF page format by providing the appropriate value.
## PDF Page Format[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation#pdf-page-format "Direct link to PDF Page Format")
You can specify the PDF page format by providing the appropriate value:
```
const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,pageFormat:PDFPageFormat.A4})).fileUri
```

## PDF Compression[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation#pdf-compression "Direct link to PDF Compression")
You can specify a maximum file size for the PDF. If the uncompressed PDF would exceed the maximum file size you have set, it will get compressed until the maximum file size is reached. Please be aware, that if the PDF gets compressed, the quality decreases and the PDF generation will take longer. In order to set a maximum file size, set the `maxSizeKB` parameter to your desired size. It needs to be set in KB, so if you want 10MB for example, set it to 10 * 1024. Please check below example:
```
const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,maxSizeKB:10240})).fileUri
```

  * Image Export

# Image Export
In addition to exporting scanned documents as **[PDF](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation)** , you can also retrieve the pages of the currently scanned document as image files (JPG).
## Export scanned pages as image files[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/imageExport#export-scanned-pages-as-image-files "Direct link to Export scanned pages as image files")
### Write images to local files[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/imageExport#write-images-to-local-files "Direct link to Write images to local files")
In order to write the currently scanned pages to local JPG files, you can use the `Document.writeImage` method. Pass the page you want to export as JPG and the target path where to save it:
```
import{DocutainSDK}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk';//...//scan a document//...try{const pageCount =(awaitDocutainSDK.pageCount()).count;for(let i =1; i <= pageCount; i++){var destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:`image${i}.jpg`,directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const imageUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writeImage({pageNumber: i,fileUri: destinationUri})).fileUri}}catch(error){console.error(error);}
```

### Get images as Base64 encoded string[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/imageExport#get-images-as-base64-encoded-string "Direct link to Get images as Base64 encoded string")
You also have the possibility to get the images as Base64 encoded string:
```
import{DocutainSDK,PageSourceType}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk';//...//scan a document//...try{const pageCount =(awaitDocutainSDK.pageCount()).count;for(let i =1; i <= pageCount; i++){const imageBytes =(awaitDocutainSDK.getImageBytes({pageNumber: i,pageSourceType:PageSourceType.CutFilter})).bytes}}catch(error){console.error(error);}
```

### PageSourceType[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/imageExport#pagesourcetype "Direct link to PageSourceType")
When getting the images as Base64 encoded string, you can define a `PageSourceType`.
You have the following options:
  * `PageSourceType.CutFilter` This is the default value if you do not provide any. The image will be the cut and filtered image which is the one the user sees when finishing the scan process.
  * `PageSourceType.CutOnly` This will give you the cut but unfiltered image. If you for example use the image for further processing in your own OCR pipeline which uses custom filter operations, this option might improve your OCR results as opposed to `PageSourceType.CutFilter`. But this is no general rule and highly depends on your pipeline.
  * `PageSourceType.Original` This will give you the uncut, unfiltered image as it was provided by the camera.

  * Text Recognition

# Text Recognition
After a successful **[scan](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan)** or **[import](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/fileImport)** of a document, you can get the detected text of the entire document or single pages.
## Get the detected text[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/textDetection#get-the-detected-text "Direct link to Get the detected text")
In order to get the detected text of the entire document, call the following line of code:
```
import{ DocutainSDK }from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'//...//scan or import file//...try{const text =(await DocutainSDK.getText()).text}catch(error){console.error(error);}
```

In order to get the detected text of a specific page, call the following line of code and specify the page number:
```
import{ DocutainSDK }from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'//...//scan or import file//...try{const text =(await DocutainSDK.getTextPage({pageNumber:1})).text}catch(error){console.error(error);}

## Data Extraction

> Source: https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/dataExtraction

  * Data Extraction

# Data Extraction
Docutains **Data Extraction/ Data Capture SDK for Capacitor** can extract document data based on the **[detected text](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/textDetection)**.
## Set Analyze Configuration[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/dataExtraction#set-analyze-configuration "Direct link to Set Analyze Configuration")
If you do not need to analyze for `BIC` and `PaymentState`, you can skip this section and jump directly to **[Get the detected data](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/dataExtraction#get-the-detected-data)**.
If you want to analyze `BIC` and / or `PaymentState`, you need to set the analyze configuration accordingly.
This needs to be done **before** the scan process is started. The best place to do this is right after [**initializing**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/sdkInit) the SDK.
```
import{DocutainSDK,AnalyzeConfiguration}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk';// ...// Initialize the SDK first, then set the Analyze Configuration // ...try{awaitDocutainSDK.setAnalyzeConfigurationDocScan({readBIC:true,readPaymentState:true,});}catch(error){//setAnalyzeConfiguration of Docutain SDK failed, get the last error messageconsole.error(error);}
```

## Get the detected data[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/dataExtraction#get-the-detected-data "Direct link to Get the detected data")
In order to get the detected data of the **[scanned](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/docScan)** or **[imported](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/fileImport)** document, call the following line of code:
```
import{DocutainSDK}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk';//...//scan or import file//...try{const analyzeData =(awaitDocutainSDK.analyze()).data;}catch(error){console.error(error);}
```

The detected data will be returned as `JSON` string. Depending on how you configured your `AnalyzeConfiguration`, the structure will be one of the two following. The differences will be in IBAN, Bank and PaymentState.
When reading `BIC` is deactivated (default behaviour), you will get a value `IBAN` which contains all detected IBANs:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"Verbandsgemeindeverwaltung Nastätten","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"56352","City":"Nastätten","Street":"Postfach","Phone":"06772 802 0","CustomerId":"","IBAN":["DE76570928000208303503","DE41510500150710030316"]},"Date":"2020-01-24","Amount":"940.84","InvoiceId":"20/VA06894/0009500","Reference":"RNr:20/VA06894/0009500 vom 24.01.2020"}
```

When reading `BIC` is activated, you will get a value `Bank` which contains tuples of the `BIC` and the `IBAN`, if any detected:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"Verbandsgemeindeverwaltung Nastätten","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"56352","City":"Nastätten","Street":"Postfach","Phone":"06772 802 0","CustomerId":"","Bank":[{"BIC":"GENODE51DIE","IBAN":"DE76570928000208303503"},{"BIC":"NASSDE55XXX","IBAN":"DE41510500150710030316"}]},"Date":"2020-01-24","Amount":"940.84","InvoiceId":"20/VA06894/0009500","Reference":"RNr:20/VA06894/0009500 vom 24.01.2020"}
```

When reading the payment state is activated, you will get a value `PaymentState` which contains either `Paid` or `ToBePaid`:
```
{"Address":{"Name1":"Verbandsgemeindeverwaltung Nastätten","Name2":"","Name3":"","Zipcode":"56352","City":"Nastätten","Street":"Postfach","Phone":"06772 802 0","CustomerId":"","Bank":[{"BIC":"GENODE51DIE","IBAN":"DE76570928000208303503"},{"BIC":"NASSDE55XXX","IBAN":"DE41510500150710030316"}]},"Date":"2020-01-24","Amount":"940.84","InvoiceId":"20/VA06894/0009500","Reference":"RNr:20/VA06894/0009500 vom 24.01.2020","PaymentState":"ToBePaid"}

## Onboarding

> Source: https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding

  * Onboarding

# Onboarding
The SDK provides 2 optional onboarding possibilities that will be shown to the user on first start with some default content. It can be disabled, if you do not want to use it. You can also alter the contents of the onboarding to adopt it to your needs. 
## Full Screen View Pager[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#full-screen-view-pager "Direct link to Full Screen View Pager")
The first option provides a full screen view pager with swipable content that opens once before the camera starts.
By default, this option is deactivated on the document scan and activated on the photo payment process.
![onboardingDataProtection](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingDataProtection-4499ace510a03b6378b8230f869a6a71.jpg) ![onboardingLightingConditions](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingLightingConditions-9b8e598d77be388c84fb27045c90f490.jpg)
## Scan Hint Popup[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#scan-hint-popup "Direct link to Scan Hint Popup")
The second option is a popup on the scanning screen. 
By default, this option is activated on document scan and on photo payment.
![onboardingScanHintPopup](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingScanHintPopup-29bcc50607923d9cfb52e0f5a0aa0cf7.jpg)
## Customize[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#customize "Direct link to Customize")
Button colors are configured by the global **[color configuration](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/colorConfig)**.
### Onboarding[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#onboarding-1 "Direct link to Onboarding")
You can use the `onboarding` option as part of the document scan or photo payment process to alter the default onboarding behaviour to your needs. Currently the following values can be set:
Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`items`| `DocutainListItem[]`| The items you want to show within the onboarding. If you don't provide any items, some default items will be displayed in case of photo payment. In case of document scan, onboarding won't be shown. See below code sample for more details.  
`buttonNext`| `DocutainButton`| The button that goes to the next item.  
`buttonFinish`| `DocutainButton`| The button that closes the onboarding on the last item.  
`buttonSkip`| `DocutainButton`| The button to skip (close) the onboarding.  
`buttonBack`| `DocutainButton`| The button that goes to the previous item. It is disabled by default.  
`scanHintPopup`| `ScanHintPopup?`| A popup that appears when scan is opened for the first time, explaining the user how to scan. See [**ScanHintPopup**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#scanhintpopup) for more details.  
If you want to provide your own swipeable items instead of the default items, you can do that by providing your own list of `DocutainListItem`. Each item consists of an `image`, a `title` and a `message`. 
`image` needs to be a name of an image resource in the drawable folder (Android), respectively the name of an image in your assets catalog (iOS).
  * Document Scan
  * Photo Payment

```
const onboardingDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.onboardingDefaultItems()).items;const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({onboarding:{items:[   onboardingDefaultItems[2],   onboardingDefaultItems[4],{image:"my_icon",title:"my onboarding page 3",message:"page 1 is default page 3\npage 2 is default page 5\npage 3 is custom item"}]}});
```

```
const onboardingDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.onboardingDefaultItems()).items;const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:{items:[   onboardingDefaultItems[2],   onboardingDefaultItems[4],{image:"my_icon",title:"my onboarding page 3",message:"page 1 is default page 3\npage 2 is default page 5\npage 3 is custom item"}]}});
```

info
You can get the default items used by the SDK to use them for your own list.
```
const onboardingDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.onboardingDefaultItems()).items;
```

The following sample alters the `buttonNext`. 
`icon` needs to be a name of an image resource in the drawable folder (Android), respectively the name of an image in your assets catalog (iOS).
  * Document Scan
  * Photo Payment

```
const onboardingDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.onboardingDefaultItems()).items;const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({onboarding:{items: onboardingDefaultItems,buttonNext:{title:"my next button",icon:"my_icon"}}});
```

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:{buttonNext:{title:"my next button",icon:"my_icon"}}});
```

### ScanHintPopup[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#scanhintpopup "Direct link to ScanHintPopup")
The following provides an overview of the currently available options to alter the `scanHintPopup`:
Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`title`| `string`| The text to display as title.  
`message`| `string`| The text to display as message.  
`closeButton`| `string`| The text of the close button.  
`imageSource`| `string`| The image to display. On Android, this needs to be a name of an image resource in the drawable folder. On iOS, it needs to be the name of an image in your assets catalog.  
The following sample alters the `imageSource`. 
`imageSource` needs to be a name of an image resource in the drawable folder (Android), respectively the name of an image in your assets catalog (iOS).
  * Document Scan
  * Photo Payment

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({onboarding:{scanHintPopup:{imageSource:"my_scan_hint_popup_image"}}});
```

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:{scanHintPopup:{imageSource:"my_scan_hint_popup_image"}}});
```

## Disable[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#disable "Direct link to Disable")
If you don't want to use either of them, just set the `onboarding` option to null.
  * Document Scan
  * Photo Payment

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({onboarding:null});
```

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:null});
```

If you want to use the swipable onboarding, but not the popup, set the `scanHintPopup` option to null.
  * Document Scan
  * Photo Payment

```
const onboardingDefaultItems =(awaitDocutainSDK.onboardingDefaultItems()).items;const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({onboarding:{items: onboardingDefaultItems,scanHintPopup:null}});
```

```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:{scanHintPopup:null}});
```

If you want to use the popup for Photo Payment, but not the swipable onboarding, set the `items` option to an empty array [].
For document scan, this is the default option.
```
const result =awaitDocutainSDK.startPhotoPayment({onboarding:{items:[]}});
```

## Reset[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding#reset "Direct link to Reset")
Both onboarding options are shown only once. If you want to show them again, you can use the `resetOnboarding` method. You can chose which one you want to reset:
```
awaitDocutainSDK.resetOnboarding({onboarding:true,scanHintPopup:true,});
```

  * Document Scan

# Document Scan
With Docutain's Document Scanner SDK for capacitor, you can integrate document scanning into your app within minutes. It includes ready-to-use UI components that can be altered to your needs and coprorate design.
It is also possible to use the Document Scanner on imported images.
![ScanEditPreview](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/ScanEditUI-b57833e318cfd8f246317a5d693e6a22.png)
## Scan with Camera[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#scan-with-camera "Direct link to Scan with Camera")
### Camera Permission[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#camera-permission "Direct link to Camera Permission")
#### Android[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#android "Direct link to Android")
Declare the following permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
```
<uses-permissionandroid:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/><uses-featureandroid:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
```

info
Runtime permission for camera is handled automatically by the Docutain SDK.
#### iOS[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#ios "Direct link to iOS")
You need to specify the reason for requesting access to the camera as part of the `NSCameraUsageDescription` in the `Info.plist`. If you don't the app will crash.
![NSCameraUsageDescription](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/NSCameraUsageDescription-2e43ad7b2b43a107283452dce1a04cec.png)
### Start Camera Scan[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#start-camera-scan "Direct link to Start Camera Scan")
To start the scan process you only have to call `DocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner` and wait for it to return.
You can pass options to change some behaviours and theming to adopt it to your needs. See **[Change default scan behaviour](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#change-default-scan-behaviour)** for possible custom settings.
```
import{DocutainSDK,PDFPageFormat}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'asyncscanDocument(){try{awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({//customize the scanner config according to your needs});//user finished scan process, continue with your workflow//generate PDFvar destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:"sample.pdf",directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,overWrite:true,pageFormat:PDFPageFormat.A4})).fileUri//get detected Textconst text =(awaitDocutainSDK.getText()).text//get extracted data const analyzeData =(awaitDocutainSDK.analyze()).data;}catch(error){if((error as{ code?: string })?.code ==='CANCELED'){//user canceled scan processconsole.log(`user canceled`);}else{console.error(error);}}}
```

## Scan from imported images[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#scan-from-imported-images "Direct link to Scan from imported images")
It is also possible to use the Document Scanner on already taken images, for example images selected from the users photo gallery. The process of starting the scanner on imported images is the same as when scanning with the camera. The only difference is defining a different `Source` in the `DocumentScannerConfiguration`. Possible values are:
  * `Camera` : This is the default value. Starts the Document Scanner using the devices camera.
  * `Image` : Starts the Document Scanner on images provided by you via code. Pass `sourceImages` to the `DocumentScannerConfiguration` containing the paths to the images to be scanned.
  * `Gallery` : Opens the user's photo gallery in single select mode. The Document Scanner is run on the selected image.
  * `GalleryMultiple` : Opens the user's photo gallery in multi select mode. The Document Scanner is run on the selected images.
  * `CameraImport` : Same as `Camera` but shows an additional import button which the user can use to import files as well. 

The following sample shows how to open the photo gallery in multi select mode and run the Document Scanner on the selected images:
```
import{DocutainSDK,Source,PDFPageFormat}from'@docutain/capacitor-plugin-docutain-sdk'asyncscanDocument(){try{awaitDocutainSDK.startDocumentScanner({source:Source.GalleryMultiple});//user finished scan process, continue with your workflow//generate PDFvar destinationUri =(awaitFilesystem.getUri({path:"sample.pdf",directory:Directory.Data})).uri;const pdfUri =(awaitDocutainSDK.writePDF({fileUri: destinationUri,overWrite:true,pageFormat:PDFPageFormat.A4})).fileUri//get detected Textconst text =(awaitDocutainSDK.getText()).text//get extracted data const analyzeData =(awaitDocutainSDK.analyze()).data;}catch(error){if((error as{ code?: string })?.code ==='CANCELED'){//user canceled scan processconsole.log(`user canceled`);}else{console.error(error);}}}
```

## Onboarding[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#onboarding "Direct link to Onboarding")
The SDK provides 2 optional onboarding possibilities that will be shown to the user on first start with some default content. You can customize it according to your needs or disable it completely.
See [**Onboarding**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/onboarding) for details.
![onboardingDataProtection](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingDataProtection-4499ace510a03b6378b8230f869a6a71.jpg) ![onboardingLightingConditions](https://docs.docutain.com/assets/images/onboardingLightingConditions-9b8e598d77be388c84fb27045c90f490.jpg)
## Scan Tips[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#scan-tips "Direct link to Scan Tips")
The SDK provides an optional toolbar item within the scanning screen, that when clicked, will open some tips on how to get the best scan result. By default it is deactivated. You can enable it and show some default tips or customize it according to your needs.
See [**Scan Tips**](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/scantips) for details.

### ButtonConfiguration[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#buttonconfiguration "Direct link to ButtonConfiguration")
You can use the `ButtonConfiguration` to alter the default buttons of the scanner. Each button is an object of `DocutainButton` and has a `title` and `icon` property. Buttons residing in the top toolbar can have either a title or an icon. If you define both, the icon will be displayed. Buttons residing in the bottom toolbar can have both title and icon at the same time. If you want a button to only display text, set the `icon` property to an empty string and the `title` property to the text you want to display. If you want a button to only display an icon, set the `text` property to an empty string and the `icon` property to the icon you want to display. `icon` needs to be a name of an image resource in the drawable folder (Android), respectively the name of an image in your assets catalog (iOS).
Currently the following buttons can be set:
Button| Default Value| Description  
---|---|---  
`buttonEditRotate`| ![buttonEditRotate](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming)| The button that rotates the current page.

### ColorConfiguration[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#colorconfiguration "Direct link to ColorConfiguration")
In order to fit the Docutain Scanner SDK for Capacitor into your corporate design, you have a bunch of options to alter the default color theming of the ready to use UI components. See **[color configuration](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/colorConfig)** for details.
## Result handling[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#result-handling "Direct link to Result handling")
After the scan process is successfully finished, you can do a bunch of things with the scanned pages:
**[Capacitor PDF Creation](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/pdfCreation)**
**[Capacitor Image Export](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/imageExport)**
**[Capacitor Text Detection](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/textDetection)**
**[Capacitor Data Extraction](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/dataExtraction)**
## Language Support[​](https://docs.docutain.com/docs/capacitor/theming#language-support "Direct link to Language Support")
The device's locale determines the language used by the Docutain SDK.
Currently, the SDK provides default translations for the following languages:
  * English
  * Arabic
  * Bulgarian
  * Chinese, Simplified
  * Chinese, Traditional
  * Croation
  * Czech
  * Danish
  * Dutch
